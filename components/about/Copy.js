      Research and development (R&D) teams are the fastest growing at Apple. R&D
      is also an area where diversity continues to lag across the tech industry.
      We have several ongoing and upcoming initiatives to help break down
      systemic barriers and bias in R&D and beyond.
    </p>
    <h3>Making a difference with underrepresented communities.</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to Apple programs like Entrepreneur Camp, Impact Accelerator,
      and the Apple Developer Academy, Apple partners with external
      organizations to support and serve people from underrepresented
      communities. Many of our partnerships also provide opportunities for our
      engineers and other employees to engage with the next generation of
      innovators by offering their time as mentors and volunteers.
    </p>
    <h3>More than 100 scholarships each year.</h3>
    <p>
      Building on the success of the Apple HBCU Scholars program, Apple is
      committed to expanding opportunities for more students from more
      communities. With our partners, we continue to create over 100 additional
      scholarships annually for STEAM students from underrepresented
      communities. The Apple Scholars program includes financial support,
      mentorship, and career development experience.
